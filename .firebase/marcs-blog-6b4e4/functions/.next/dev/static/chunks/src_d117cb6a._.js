Our original website, preserved for posterity, can be seen at [isis3d.net](http://www.isis3d.net). (Regarding the name: it seemed fantastic in 2012: short, and relevant to making things. We had no idea of the world events that would soon unfold.)

[IMAGE:0]

Though it has become a poster child for undeserved hype, 3D printing looked in 2012 like a technology with fundamentally transformative potential. We believed (and still do), that additive manufacturing would play a major role in the world economy by making it possible to produce highly complex physical objects very cheaply.

We decided to begin at the consumer end, where the 3D printers of the day were notoriously unreliable—prints required constant babysitting and still failed more often than not. The printers of 2012 were toys and little more.

[IMAGE:1]

The new design we set out to create had to be useful as something more than a toy:

1. It had to produce useful engineering prototypes, with fit and finish suitable for meaningful design work.
2. It had to produce any geometry. Soluble support was essential.
3. It had to be reliable. If a print could not be counted on to go to completion, nothing else mattered.

[IMAGE:2]

We created the Isis One, achieving good layer stacking by testing over a dozen linear systems, designing a rigid heated borosilicate print bed with dynamic bed leveling, and creating a robust dual-extruder printhead for soluble support.

## Adhesion

The first and most vexing problem to solve was the first layer. For an FDM print to succeed, it must stay well adhered throughout the print, but then come off the bed with minimum effort. Stratasys solved this with soluble support on replaceable ABS beds. We needed our print surface to be indefinitely reusable.

We ran dozens of tests trying surfaces of different glass and plastic, heated to different temperatures, treated with various substances. After many hours, we found PLA stuck reliably to borosilicate glass at 50℃ treated with AquaNet hairspray.

## Bed Levelness and Rigidity

The bed must be perfectly level relative to the extruder's plane of travel, with vertical offset of 100 ± 25 microns for a good first layer. Getting correct settings usually required five false starts, and popping a completed print off threw it out of kilter.

[IMAGE:1]

We ended up with a double-decker design: an aluminum undercarriage on two linear rails connected to the borosilicate bed by polycarbonate corner blocks on neoprene washers for adjustable leveling.

[IMAGE:2]

The notion of gluing directly to borosilicate was novel at the time. We replaced PCB heaters with a custom high-wattage Kapton heater, solving the differential expansion problem.

## Dynamic Bed Leveling

No matter how assiduously we leveled, first layer height was never reliable at the margins. We implemented dynamic bed leveling—measuring actual offset at multiple points and compensating in real time. This had not yet made it to the consumer market.

One of the most obvious determiners of print quality is the linear systems. A good linear system is repeatable enough for excellent layer stacking and rigid enough for adequate speed. We spent more time on this than almost any other aspect.

## Rods, and the Linear Rails Fad

Early consumer FDM printers almost all used rods, though none had well-implemented systems. Bearings were seldom good and alignment was difficult.

[IMAGE:1]

We ordered many different options and were surprised to see poor results from linear rails, even expensive ones. All had too much slop for good layer stacking.

## Solving the Binding Problem

[IMAGE:2]

We floated the Z leadscrew nut with a spring arrangement, giving it play in X and Y but not Z. For the linear bearings, floating one bearing—giving it a few hundred microns of play—achieved truly smooth motion without hurting print quality.

[IMAGE:3]

## V-Slot

A new product called V-slot appeared: aluminum extrusion with beveled slot edges, using Delrin V-wheels tensioned with eccentric spacers. We were blown away by the quality.

[IMAGE:4]

We learned that crowds are frequently wrong, price and quality often show little correlation, and one's own empirical data is essential.`

Modern hardware is 90% software. Small software modifications contributed major improvements to print quality, speed, and reliability.

## Speed

FDM printers are inherently slow. Conventional wisdom was that good quality couldn't be obtained past 35 mm/s.

[IMAGE:1]

The mechanism limiting speed was "wobble artifacts"—as the nozzle turned corners, it would wobble slightly. By reducing speed and acceleration of outer perimeters to conservative values, we completely eliminated wobble artifacts. The rest could proceed at 150 mm/s, a 2-3x improvement.

## Cooling, Bridging, and Overhang

FDM printers are surprisingly capable of overhangs with good cooling. Judicious control of temperature and fan settings bought massive improvements.

## Extrusion/Retract

[IMAGE:2]

Stringing—spiderweb-like fibers during crossing moves—is solved by retracting filament. We had good luck with small, jerky retracts and wiping the extruder across the finished region. Combined with printhead improvements, we almost entirely eliminated stringing.`

Soluble support would enable truly geometry-agnostic printing. Stratasys had implemented it, but it hadn't reached the consumer market.

[IMAGE:1]

## Design Considerations

We needed to reduce printhead mass by half (for two extruders), keep nozzles within 15mm, improve throughput, reduce melt chamber size (causing dribbling), and make the feed wheel more robust.

[IMAGE:2]

## The New Design

The design delivered massive torque through two driven feedwheels via a custom gearbox on a NEMA 17 stepper. A thin stainless steel barrel (rather than aluminum) enabled a steep heat gradient.

[IMAGE:3]

Heat traveled up the barrel aggressively, causing swelling. Airflow from the print cooling fan plus a teflon liner solved it.

[IMAGE:4]

## Getting Parts Machined

After expensive dalliances in Chicago ($200/set) and Utah, we landed with a shop in Shenzhen—professional, responsive, fast, excellent parts for less than a quarter the cost.

[IMAGE:5]

## Soluble Support

[IMAGE:6]

We got a dual extruder working at 150 mm/s with almost no stringing. Using PVA support material, we achieved soluble support.

The server passes messages and stores files. Commands are marked as executed by the Tinkerboard.

## Stepper Drivers

[IMAGE:1]

[A4988s](https://www.pololu.com/product/1182)—super common, familiar to anyone who's assembled a 3D printer. They cost $2-3, drive up to 2A with cooling, rated to 35V. Two input pins (step and direction) plus stepper enable. We're using 1/16th microstepping.

## MOSFETs

[IMAGE:2]

PHT4NQ10LT surface mount N-Channel MOSFETs—100V, 3.5A, logic level (driven directly from TTL). The LED indicates on/off, and a high-value resistor between gate and ground helps shutoff.

## Designing the Board

I used [Upverter](http://www.upverter.com) (online e-CAD). Create schematic, lay out on board, route, do a ground pour, export gerbers.

## Manufacturing

[SeeedStudio](http://www.seeedstudio.com)—$5 for 10x two-layer boards up to 100x100mm. Under $25 including shipping from China, better than two weeks turnaround.`

Gameplay splits between on-planet and in-transit events. On-planet uses a five-part tab view:

├─ System: Orientation, quests, refuel and repair
├─ Sell: Sell cargo with profit/loss per unit
├─ Buy: Purchase goods, see prices across systems
├─ Shipyard: Shop for ships and equipment
└─ Warp: Consult charts, choose destination, initiate warp

During warp, you experience encounters with pirates and police. You may fight or flee, potentially disabling opponents and earning reputation.

Buy and sell screens use grids of manually arranged UIButtons and UILabels subclasses to recreate the text-based feel.

Navigation charts use custom UIView objects with draw functions rendering planets, crosshairs, and range circles.

## Data Structure

Game data lives in Commander (player data) and Galaxy (generated galaxy, planet locations, market conditions). Additional classes: Ship, CrewMember, Gadget, HighScore, Journey, Newspaper, PoliticsType, SavedGame, Shield, SpecialEvent, StarSystem, TradeItem, UniversalGadget.`

        content: `The encounter sequence presented considerable challenge in handling control flow between view controllers and the data model. Encounters begin after dropping out of hyperspace, on the final 20 clicks to destination.

The logic:

├─ WarpVC calls Galaxy.warp() after verifying debts/fuel
├─ Galaxy.warp() instantiates a Journey and calls beginJourney()
├─ NSNotification fires segue to WarpViewVC (blank starfield background)
├─ journey.resumeJourney() calls executeClick(), determining encounters
├─ When encounter happens:
│  ├─ Encounter class is instantiated
│  ├─ NSNotification launches EncounterVC modal
│  ├─ EncounterVC shows images, labels, four buttons
│  ├─ Buttons call appropriate Encounter functions
│  ├─ Subsequent stages happen within same EncounterVC via NSNotifications
│  └─ On conclusion, EncounterVC is popped from stack
└─ At zero clicks, journey.completeJourney() resets planet and dismisses WarpViewVC`

        content: `## Quests and Special Events

A "Special" button occasionally appears, enabling quests involving long journeys, wild goose chases, special opponents, and people to take home.

A specialEventID assigned to a system causes the button to appear, loading SpecialVC with appropriate text. When accepted, information logs to the specialEvent class. Immediate actions—adding crewmembers or equipment—happen from SpecialVC.

The difficulty: notifications and interactions scattered through the game. Tribbles eat food, devalue your ship, cause fine warnings, and die from radiation if you're also carrying an unstable reactor. All had to be manually coded throughout.

## Data Persistence

After exploring CoreData, I used NSCoding encode/decode on each class. A game wraps up by encoding Commander and Galaxy. AppDelegate handles loading/unloading on applicationWillResignActive() and applicationWillBecomeActive().

## Debugging

Launch revealed many issues. The most vexing: increasing lags during encounters, eventually crashing and losing the game. The problem: instead of dismissing WarpViewVC, the app fired a segue, stacking copies. Dismissing instead of segueing solved it.`
