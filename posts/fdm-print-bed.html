            <h3>Adhesion</h3>
            <p>The first and most vexing problem to solve to make FDM work was that of the first layer. For an FDM print to
                succeed, it must stay well adhered throughout the duration of the print, but then come off the bed with a
                minimum of effort and force. Stratasys solved this problem with a two-part strategy of printing on a raft
                of soluble support material, which itself stuck forcefully (and permanently) to a replaceable ABS print bed.
                Although we wanted ultimately to add soluble support, it was important that our process not rely on it, and
                further important that our print surface be indefinitely reusable, so this solution was definitely out.</p>
            <p>The internet had a great deal to say about the adhesion problem. A theme that we would quickly notice was that
                the large and lively open source community of the RepRap world had no shortage of suggestions, but there
                was no system for testing one against another and little interest in getting to the bottom of things. We
                realized that our role was largely to aggregate ideas and subject them to a level of rigorous side-by-side
                testing that no one else seemed willing to do, setting a high standard for acceptability.</p>

            <p>We ran dozens of tests on our initial prototype printer, trying surfaces made out of different kinds of glass
                and plastic, heated to different temperatures, and treated with various substances. Some combinations we
                tried failed outright, but many worked well enough for prints to go to completion some of the time, but not
                reliably. After a lot of hours of printing, we figured out that PLA stuck reliably well to borosilicate glass
                at 50℃, if it was treated with AquaNet hairspray. We greatly appreciate the community’s help on this one—the
                hairspray we definitely wouldn’t have come up with on our own!</p>

            <h3>Bed levelness and rigidity</h3>

            <p>Given a suitable material and thermal situation, the bed still must be perfectly level relative to the plane
                of travel of the extruder. Moreover, the vertical offset between the two must be 100 ± 25 microns to achieve
                a good first layer. Getting the correct settings dialed in usually required about five false starts, and
                the force of popping a completed print off the bed was all it took to throw it all out of kilter, requiring
                the user to repeat the process for the next print.</p>

            <p>Clearly, we needed a very rigid print bed with a robust leveling system. Our bed also served as the printer’s
                Y axis, so the bed had to be lightweight to avoid exacting a penalty allowable acceleration. We ended up
                with a double-decker design, in which an aluminum undercarriage was supported on two widely-spaced linear
                rails and connected to the borosilicate bed by four polycarbonate corner blocks, themselves glued to the
                glass. The corner blocks sat on neoprene washers, such that by tightening the screws that held them to the
                carriage, the washers could be variably compressed. It was thus possible to adjust the relative height of
                each corner individually.</p>

            <p>The notion of gluing directly to the back of the borosilicate, ridiculous though this sounds, was novel at the
                time. The heaters commonly used in 2012 were made from (fiberglass) PCBs, and expanded at a different rate
                than glass. If they were glued to the glass, this differential expansion caused a disasterous warping effect.
                Consequently, the leading design practice was to eschew any kind of adhesive and hold the whole stack together
                with binder clips on the corners, an expedient that clearly minimized the repeatability of the entire arrangement
                and also cut into the available print area. We replaced the PCB heater with a custom high-wattage Kapton
                heater, sourced from Alibaba. Thin and flexible, and attached with a flexible adhesive, this solved the warping
                problem and made the glued foot design work.</p>
            <p>We finished our bed design with an adjustable endstop calibration screw for the Z axis to control the absolute
                vertical offset. Leveling the bed was still an arduous process, but it could now be done once and hold indefinitely.
            </p>

            <h3>Dynamic bed leveling</h3>

            <p>We declared victory over the bed leveling situation and carried on, but as the hours of printing racked up, we
                realized we were still unsatisfied with first layers. Having a full one-foot-square print bed was an important
                design spec of the Isis One. Most printers on the market at the time had small print volumes, and in any
                case lacked the reliability to print more than one or two items at a time. It was important to us to be able
                to run very long prints of many parts at a time. No matter how assiduously we leveled the bed, first layer
                height was never reliably right at the margins. We needed to do better still.</p>

            <p>The notion of dynamic bed leveling—measuring the actual offset of the bed at a number of points, and using the
                printer’s vertical axis to compensate in real time—was implemented by Stratasys, but had not yet made it
                to the consumer market. We decided to bite the bullet and implement this as well.</p>

            <p>The software implementation was comparatively easy, but installing a reliable, low-cost, and lightweight actuator
                to lower a probe proved more difficult. We ended up with a design based on an RC servo and, after troubleshooting
                a bizarre issue by which electrical noise from the stepper wiring induced a signal in the servo’s signal
                line causing it to jitter manically, had a workable system. Now at last you could load up the entire volume
                with parts, hit print, and walk away with confidence that bed adhesion issues would not cause your print
                to fail.</p>
