            <h3>Gameplay Overview</h3>
            <p>Gameplay is broken into two main categories, events that happen on the planet, and those that happen in transit
                between one planet and another. The on-planet portion of the game takes place within a five part tab view
                controller. The parts are as follows:</p>
            <ul.browserDefault>
                <li>System, which orients the user upon his arrival to a new star system. This screen shows him any quests that
                    might be available, and gives him a chance to refuel and repair his ship.</li>
                <li>Sell: where he can sell the cargo he currently has on hand. Profit/loss per unit is displayed.</li>
                <li>Buy, where he can purchase goods to trade. He can rifle through the other star systems in range, seeing local
                    price differences, so as to identify trade opportunities.</li>
                <li>Shipyard, where the player can shop for ships and equipment.</li>
                <li>Warp, where the player can consult local and galactic charts, choose a destination, and initiate a warp.</li>
            </ul.browserDefault>
            <p>During a warp journey, the player experiences a sequence of encounters, with pirates and officers of the law,
                who will attempt to plunder his cargo and enforce prohibitions against the trade of contraband, respectively.
                He may fight or flee, potentially disabling and plundering or destroying his opponents, and earning a reputation
                in the process.</p>

            <!-- tab view controller 1 -->

                <img src="./space-trader-implementation/systemInfo.png" class="extraPadding" title="System Info"
                alt="System Info" />
                <img src="./space-trader-implementation/sellCargo.png" class="extraPadding" title="Sell Cargo"
                alt="Sell Cargo" />
                <img src="./space-trader-implementation/buyCargo.png" class="extraPadding" title="Buy Cargo"
                alt="Buy Cargo" />

            <p>In the interest of recreating the feel of the original, text-based game, the buy and sell screens are made with
                grids of manually arranged subclasses of UIButtons and UILabels. By switching classes, elements can be made
                to appear, disappear, and change text size and color. Everything is included within a scrollView, to handle
                the case of the 4” screen, which is too small to display the entire table at once.</p>

            <!-- tab view controller 2 -->
            <img src="./space-trader-implementation/shipyard.png" class="extraPadding" title="Shipyard"
                alt="Shipyard" />
                <img src="./space-trader-implementation/warp.png" class="extraPadding" title="Warp"
                alt="Warp" />
                <img src="./space-trader-implementation/galacticChart.png" class="extraPadding" title="Galactic Chart"
                alt="Galactic Chart" />

            <p>The navigation charts were accomplished with custom UIView objects, in which draw functions are used to render
                planets from the galaxy class, as well as crosshairs indicating selection, and a range circle indicating
                the distance the player can travel.</p>



            <h3>Data Structure</h3>
            <p>Game data is contained in instances of two classes, Commander, which contains all data pertaining to the player,
                and Galaxy, which stores everything about the automatically generated galaxy, including planet locations
                and market conditions. Additional classes, such as Ship, CrewMember, Gadget, HighScore, Journey, Newspaper,
                PoliticsType, SavedGame, Shield, SpecialEvent, StarSystem, TradeItem, and UniversalGadget, are used to structure
                other aspects of gameplay.</p>
